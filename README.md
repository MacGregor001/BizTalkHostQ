# BizTalkHostQ
A T-SQL query that displays the number of messages in a BizTalk Host.  It breaks out the number that are queued up and the ones that are actively being processed.  In addition, this query will tell you what the decrease (or increase) in messages is since the last time the SQL was run.  Enjoy!
